The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more. While te primary usage 
focuses on the penetration testing domain, it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development

Main components of the Metasploit Framework 
msfconsole --> Main command-line interface
Modules --> supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc
Tools --> Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetrating testing.
msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset. 

Exploit --> A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system
Vulnerability --> A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information 
or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system
Payload --> An exploit will take afvantage of vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want, we need to use a payloads. Payloads are the code that will run on the target machine

Auxiliary 
Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, can be found here

Encoders 
Allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them 

Adapters --> Wraps single payloads to convert them into different formats. For example, a normal single payload can be wrapped inside a powershell adapter, which will make
a single powershell command that will execute the payload
Singles --> Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run
Stragers --> Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. "Staged payload"
will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the inital size of the payload
will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once 
Stages --> Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payload

Concurrency --> Number of targets to be scanned simultanesously
Ports --> port range to be scanned
RHOSTS --> Target or target network to be scanned 
Thread --> Number of threads that will be used simultanesouly. More threads will result in faster scan

UDP service identification 
You can use exploit --> scanner/discovery/udp_sweep

SMB scan 
You can use exploit --> smb_enumshares or smb_version 
scanner/smb/smb_version

HTTP --> Could potentially host a web application where you can find vulnerability like SQL injection or Remote Code Execute (RCE)
FTP --> Could allow anonymous login and provide access to interesting files 
SMB --> Could be vulnerable to SMB exploits like MS17-010
SSH --> Could have default or easy to guess credentials 
RDP --> Could be vulnerabile to bluekeep or allow desktop access if weak credentials were used
