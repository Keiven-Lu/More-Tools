//Use for scanning an IP address to see what ports are open and depending on those port there are certain things you can try to do to hack it or get information.

//nmap [Ip}

//-sL --> Lsit scna - list targets without scanning 
//-sn --> ping scan - host discovery only
//-sT --> TCP scan, revealing open ports
//-sS --> SYN scan, Stealth Scan
//-sU --> scan for open UDP ports
//-sA --> See of ports are filtered by sending ACK packets
//-sV --> service and versions ports are running on 
//-sS --> Most common scan option
//-p- --> Scan to see what ports are open. Usually takes a while
//-F --> fast mode scans the 100 most common ports
//-O --> OS detection 
//-sV --> Service and version detection 
//-A --> OS detection, version detection, and other additions
//-Pn --> Scan hosts that appear to be down 
//-v --> verbose output 
//-d --> Debugging level - for example -d and -d9
//-oN<filename> --> Normal Output 
//-oX<filename> --> XML output
//-oG><filename> --> grep-able output
//-oA<basename> --> output in all major formats

Timing	Total Duration
T0 (paranoid)	--> 9.8 hours
T1 (sneaky)	--> 27.53 minutes
T2 (polite)	--> 40.56 seconds
T3 (normal)	--> 0.15 seconds
T4 (aggressive)	--> 0.13 seconds

Option	Explanation
-T<0-5>	--> Timing template â€“ paranoid (0), sneaky (1), polite (2), normal (3), aggressive (4), and insane (5)
--min-parallelism <numprobes> and --max-parallelism <numprobes>	--> Minimum and maximum number of parallel probes
--min-rate <number> and --max-rate <number>	--> Minimum and maximum rate (packets/second)
--host-timeout	--> Maximum amount of time to wait for a target host
