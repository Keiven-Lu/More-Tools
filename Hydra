//It is very fast and flexible

//Basic Format:
// hydra -t 16 -l [username] -p [path] -vv [Machine_IP] ssh

//-t 16 --> Number of parallel connect per attempt. Essentially it speeds up the cracking process. 
//-l [Username] --> whatever you put in the username will be use as the 'username' that hydra gonna try to find the password for
//-p [path] --> This is the path or the folder that store the password that hydra is gonna use to crack the login
//-vv --> Shows the login attempts with username and password
