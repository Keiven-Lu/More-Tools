Symmetric encryption, also known as sysmmetric cryptography, uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data. Keeping the key secret is a must; it is also called private key
Furthermore, communicating the key to the intended parties can be challenging as it requires a secure communication channel. Maintaining the secrecy of the key can be a 
significant challenge, especually if there are many recipients. The problems becomes more severe in the presence of a powerful adversary; consider the threat of industrial espionage.

Asymmetric encryption uses the same key for ecryption and decryption, asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys, one to encrypt and the other to decrypt. To protect 
confidentiality, asymmetric encryption or asymmetric cryptography encrypts the data using the public key; hence it is also called public key cryptography

Authentication: You want to be sure you communicate with the right person, not someone else pretending.
Authenticity: You can verify that the information comes from the claimed source.
Integrity: You must ensure that no one changes the data you exchange.
Confidentiality: You want to prevent an unauthorised party from eavesdropping on your conversations.

p and q are large prime numbers
n is the product of p and q
The public key is n and e
The private key is n and d
m is used to represent the original message, i.e., plaintext
c represents the encrypted text, i.e., ciphertext

DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) is a public-key cryptography algorithm specifically designed for digital signatures.
ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is a variant of DSA that uses elliptic curve cryptography to provide smaller key sizes for equivalent security.
ECDSA-SK (ECDSA with Security Key) is an extension of ECDSA. It incorporates hardware-based security keys for enhanced private key protection.
Ed25519 is a public-key signature system using EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) with Curve25519.
Ed25519-SK (Ed25519 with Security Key) is a variant of Ed25519. Similar to ECDSA-SK, it uses a hardware-based security key for improved private key protection.

Bob chooses two prime numbers: p = 157 and 1 = 199. he calculates n = p * q =31243 
With ϕ(n) = n - p - q + 1 = 31243 - 157 - 199 + 1 = 30888, Bob selectes e = 163 such that e is relatively prime to ϕ(n);
moreover, he selects d = 379, where e * d = 1 mod ϕ(n), i.e., e * d = 163 * 379 = 61777 and 61777 mod 30888 = 1. The public key is (n,e), i.e., 
(31243,163) and the private key is $(n,d), i.e., (31243,379)

Cryptography is the science of securing communication and data using codes and ciphers 
Cryptanalysis is the study of methods to break or bypass cryptographic security systems without knowing the key 
Brute-Force Attack is an attack method that involves trying every possible key or passwords to decrypt a message 
Dictinoary Attack is an attack method where the attacker tries dictionary words or combination of them.
