A shell is software that allows a user to interact with an OS. It can be graphical interface, but it is usually a command-line interface,
and will depend on the operating system running on the target system.
In cyber security, it commonly refers to a specific shell session an attacker uses when accessing a compromised system, allowing them to run commands and execute 
software. This allow attackers to execute several activites, some of which are described below:

Remote System Control --> Allows the attacker to execute commands or software remotely in the target system
Privilege Escalation --> If initial access through a shell is limited or restricted, attackers can explore ways to escalate privileges to more elevated or administrative access
Data Exfileration --> Once attackers have access to execute commands through an obtained shell, they can explore the system to read and copy sensitive data from it
Persistence and Maintenance Access --> Once shell access is obtained, attackers can create access through users and credentials or copy backdoor software to maintain access to the target system for later usage
Post-Explotation Activites --> After access to a shell is granted, attackers can perform a wide range of post-exploitation activities, such as deploying malware, creating hidden accounts, and deleting information
Access other systems on the network --> Depending on the attacker's intentions, the obtained shell can be just an initial access point. The goal can be to hop through the network to a different target using the obtained 
shell as a pivot to different point sin the compromised system network. This is also known as pivoting

Reverse Shell 
nc -lvnp (port)
Sometimes referred to as a "connect back shell", is one of the most popular techniques for gaining access to a system in cyberattacks. The connections initiate from the target's machine, which can help avoid detection from network 
firewalls and other security appliances

Bind Shell
nc -nv (ip) (port)
A bind shell will bind a port on the compromised system and listen for a connection; when this connection occurs, it exposes the shell session so the attacker can execute commands remotely.
This methods can be used when the compromised target does not allow outgoing connections, but it tends to be less popular since it needs to remain active and listen for connections, whcih can lead to detection

Rlwrap
It is small utility that uses the GNU readline library to provide editing keyboard and history 
rlwrap nc -lvnp 443

Ncat 
Ncat is an improved version of Netcat distributed by the NMAP project. It provides extra features, like encryption
ncat -lvnp 4444
ncat --ssl -lvnp 4444
--ssl enables ssl encryption 

Socat
It is a utility that allows you to create a socket connection between two data sources, in this case, two different hosts
socat -d -d TCP-LISTEN:443 STDOUT

Web shell
A webshell is a script written in a language supported by a compromised web server that executes commands through the web server itself. 
A web shell is usually a file containing the code that executes commands and handles files. It can be hidden within a compromised web application or service, making it 
difficult to detect and very popular among attackers
